# TODO

- News does not load 100% of the time (ID problem saving to internal store)
- Pressing enter on downshift should load first item (perhaps keep first item selected unless user selects different)
- Try adding gql-tags inside components and see how generation works
- Add 'X' to clear downshift
- Implement ChartIQ
- Change subscription to send array instead of individual item??
- strip out rt-theme to bare essentials
